        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>One of my favorite dishes from my childhood.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>800g Thin beef sausages</li>
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 large brown onion</li>
            <li>2 carrots, peeled, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
            <li>1 tbsp KEEN'S Traditional Curry Powder</li>
            <li>2 tbsp fruit chutney</li>
            <li>2 cups Massel chicken style liquid stock</li>
            <li>1 cup frozen peas (optional)</li>
            <li>White Medium Grain Rice, Steamed, to serve</li>
            <li>Parsley leaves, to serve</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a large, heavy-based saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook sausages, in batches, turning, for 5 to 6 minutes or until browned all over. Transfer to a large plate.</li>
            <li>Add onion, carrot and garlic. Cook, stirring, for 5 minutes or until onion has softened. Add curry powder. Cook, stirring, for 30 seconds or until fragrant. Add fruit chutney and stock. Return sausages to pan. Cover, bring to the boil. Reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer, uncovered, for 25 minutes or until sausages are cooked through and sauce thickens.</li>
            <li>Stir in peas, if using. Season. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes or until heated through. Serve with steamed rice and sprinkled with parsley leaves.</li>
        </ol>
